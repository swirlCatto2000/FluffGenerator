# FluffGenerator

A small character creator thing I made in the terminal for fun :) Supports naming and saving the characters you generate. Maybe I might do more with it in the near future. Added some funny tip of the day stuff because why not.
Download the .zip, and extract fluffGenerator to somewhere on your desktop; and run FluffGenerator 1.2.exe

--------------------------
### Other Stuff

* Characters are saved to *savedCharacters* folder.
* All character accessories, tip of the day, etc is stored in *external data*.
